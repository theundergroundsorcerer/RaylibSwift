/**
 * Trace logging functionality
 *
 * This namespace contains types and functions for controlling logging output,
 * including log levels and message formatting. It provides a Swift-friendly
 * interface to raylib's tracing and debugging capabilities.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```swift
 * // Set the logging level
 * TraceLog.setLevel(.warning)
 *
 * // Log messages at different levels
 * TraceLog.log(.info, "Game initialized successfully")
 * TraceLog.log(.warning, "Resource loading failed, using fallback")
 * TraceLog.log(.error, "Could not save game state")
 * ```
 */
public enum TraceLog {
    /**
     * Trace log level types
     *
     * These levels determine what types of messages are logged
     * by the raylib trace system. They are organized by priority level.
     */
